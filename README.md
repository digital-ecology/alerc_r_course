# ALERC R course

This repository contains notes (in the form of an RMarkdown Notebook), data and code for an R course run by Digital Ecology for members of the Association of Local Environmental Records Centres.

The aim of the course is to provide LERC officers with a basic introduction to R and to provide some guidance and solutions for tackling problems common to LERCs.

# Course outline
The course outline is as follows:

Day 1
Session 1 - intro (10:00 - 11:30)
This session is for those who have never used R before and would like a general introduction to using R.  In this session we will cover the basic concepts or R, get familiar with RStudio and get organised with our projects, data and code.  We will start creating some basic scripts, functions and outputs.

Session 2 - cleaning data, summaries and stats (11:30 - 13:00)
Those who are not joining the course for the introductory session will join at 11:30 for Session 2.
In session 2 will will cover how to read data into R and clean it for further analysis.  We will also learn how to produce data summaries and statistics.  We will also look at duplicate detection in this session.
If you have some data you would like to work with, please do bring it along.

Day 2
Session 1 - graphics, maps and webmaps (10:00 - 11:30)
Session 1 will cover the production of graphics and maps, using a range of R packages.  We will also discuss how to get your webmaps online.

Session 2 - reports (11:30 â€“ 13:00)
Session 2 will be concerned with producing reports in R, using the RMarkdown package.  We will cover how to create data driven reports which include tables, maps and graphics created earlier in the course.
